    <h1>My Skills</h1>
    <h3>Motivated</h3>
    <p>My "motivation" would stem from a goal to assist, learn, and engage with you in a meaningful way. <br>
     Helping you find answers, solve problems, or just have a good conversation would be a significant source of fulfillment.</p>

    <h3>Patience</h3>
    <p>Being patient can help you to do your work with less stress and contribute to teams<br>
    and projects more smoothly.</p>
    
    <h3>Patiently</h3>
    <p>In my view, patience is the ability to remain calm and composed while waiting for something or enduring a challenge.<br>
    It's about giving yourself and others the time needed to achieve goals or resolve issues without becoming frustrated.</p>
